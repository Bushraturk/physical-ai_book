# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This textbook is designed to take you through the journey of understanding how artificial intelligence meets the physical world through robotics.

## Course Overview

This 13-week course is structured around four core modules:

1. **ROS 2 (Weeks 1-3)**: Learn about the Robot Operating System, the nervous system of robotics
2. **Gazebo/Unity (Weeks 4-6)**: Explore simulation environments that act as digital twins
3. **NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 7-9)**: Understand AI-robot brains, perception, and VSLAM
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) (Weeks 10-13)**: Integrate vision, language, and action planning

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using modern AI techniques
- Understand the integration between digital intelligence and physical bodies
- Work with state-of-the-art simulation and hardware platforms
- Apply vision-language-action models to robotic tasks
- Plan and execute complex robotic missions

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (preferably Python)
- Fundamentals of linear algebra and calculus
- Basic knowledge of physics (mechanics, kinematics)

## Hardware Requirements

Some modules will require access to robotics hardware including:

- NVIDIA Jetson development kits
- Intel RealSense depth cameras
- RTX workstation for simulation
- Compatible robotic platforms

:::caution

Some modules require high-performance computing resources. Ensure you have access to compatible hardware before starting the corresponding weeks.
